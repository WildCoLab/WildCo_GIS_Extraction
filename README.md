# GIS-extraction (Currently in development) 

This script gives worked examples of how to extract GIS information in R.

## Overview: 
Currently functions to extract:
## 1. Setup your workspace 
    - Import camera data
    - Determine the UTM code from Lat/Long coordinates
    - Create a shapefile of camera locations (using sf)
## 2. Extract trail features from OpenStreetMap (OSM)
## 3. Extract elevation at sites (including standalone download of 25m CDED raster)
## 4. Calculate distance to trails, roads, linear features
## 5. Determine terrain ruggedness (Vector Ruggedness Measure: VRM)

To-Do:
- NDVI
- EVI?
- Google Earth Engine
- Map making example (ggplot)
- Leaflet
- Calculate distance to water [Not yet implemented]
